TOBrowserActivityKit provides two UIActivity subclasses for opening NSURL objects in web browser apps on iOS.

## Features
* Supports Mobile Safari, and Chrome for iOS browser apps.
* Scales to both iPhone and iPad sizes.
* Supports iOS 6 and iOS 7 with custom icons supporting both design languages (Official iOS 8 support coming soon.).
* Icons are proceduarally drawn via Core Graphics, and can automatically scale between Retina and non-Retina devices.
* Procedural graphics also means that older version graphics (ie iOS 6) are completely optional at runtime (ie no more redundant image files!)

## Technical Requirements
iOS 6.0 or above.
