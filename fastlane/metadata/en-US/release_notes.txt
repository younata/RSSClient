Add ability to create and export eBooks from the app. Article lists now have a new book icon that, when tapped, brings up an interface to generate either an epub (for use with iBooks and most other e-readers) or a mobi (for use with Amazon Kindle) file. This can then be shared out once generated.

Improve 3d touch behavior. Add peek/pop preview actions to viewing articles and article lists.
3d links in the article view now behaves as if you'd simply tapped the link, instead of taking you out of the app.
The update breakout game is now disabled when in low-power mode, and is otherwise user-configurable to be disabled.
You can mark all articles in an article list as read, instead of having to go back out to the feed list and mark them all read from there.

Default to dark mode
