Bunch of features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

Note that this will be the last version to support iOS 8.

Adds analytics, so I can divine how to better improve features. Analytics will only report usage data, not actual data (e.g. will report that you used the web import feature, but not which specific feed).

Load content over https unless user overrides. Display message on navigation error

Show a spinner while an article is loading

Queries duckduckgo if an invalid url is entered on web import screen (e.g. type "what is this", andit'll search duckduckgo for "what is this", instead of showing an error)

Sharing features: 
 - Add a tableview action to share a feed from the feeds list
 - Add activity item shown in ArticleViewController to show articles by the same author
 - Send a link to a feed's rss from the article list controller

Hide navigation bars on swipe in article screen

Showing the estimated reading time for an article is an option configurable in settings.

Remove 'swipe to view next article' feature. It was annoying and I triggered it accidentally more often than intentionally.
Fix bug searching in articles list causing crashes.
Fix possible stack overflow when deleting an article
Better caching of datastorebackedarray count (i.e. realm can sometimes take forever to come back. Report count as 0 until it comes back)
marking a feed as read should always update the feeds screen
App should not crash when trying to add/modify tags
load up 50 objects at a time from realm
Don't double import two articles
